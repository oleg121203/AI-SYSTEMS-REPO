# AI-SYSTEMS-REPO

This repository is used by the AI-SYSTEMS software to store and manage generated code and other files. The main AI-SYSTEMS software automatically commits to this repository as part of its workflow.

## Structure

- `generated_code/`: Directory for AI-generated code files
- Other directories will be created as needed by the AI-SYSTEMS software

## Integration

This repository works in conjunction with the main [AI-SYSTEMS](https://github.com/oleg121203/AI-SYSTEMS) repository, which contains the core software and workflows.

## Purpose

The separation of repositories allows:
1. Clean separation between the core software and its outputs
2. Independent version control for generated content
3. Easier management of GitHub Actions and other CI/CD processes
